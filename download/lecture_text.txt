"""I will explain it to you. We already know that the concept of a cloud system, or cloud computing, is that we create a system and lease it out. We lease it out and get paid for it. In the case of Google, we use it for free, but the campus you use, or the core impact system, the school pays a lot of money and pays an annual usage fee. But it's cheaper and more stable than developing it ourselves, so we use it. First of all, a cloud system must provide on-demand self-service. This means that users can create their own space and use it immediately. For example, if you install an account on your smartphone, you can use it right away. So, there should be systems that allow users to use it immediately when they want it, and they should be well established. The second is that measured service must be provided. Of course, you have to bear the cost as much as you use it, and you can use it for free, so you have to use the measured service and pay as much as you use it, so these things should be well done. Then, it must have quick elasticity. What does this mean? We use one cloud system, right? For example, we are using one resource, and these things must be quickly allocated whenever we need them. Now, what I mean is that I need to increase my resource space or need more. If the capacity is 1m and it needs to be increased to 2m. If there are such things, resources must be quickly allocated, or if there are available resources, what does it mean? You have a network, right? So we share one bandwidth. Let's say it's an apartment. The apartment has two lanes, and today our guests are coming in. Then, if the apartment lane is 8 lanes, I can only use one lane, but if you have a lot of guests, I can request to use up to 8 lanes from one to two. Then, we can move flexibly like this. So, when others don't use it or when I need it, there should be a system that allocates it flexibly. So we use the cloud system. In other words, some schools, what schools, register for classes on February 1, and if they register for classes, some schools do it on February 3, so the demand of incoming students will be different. Right. We need to adjust these things and operate flexibly. That's what I'm talking about. Then, broad network access means that various terminals can connect and use at the same time. Resource pooling means that this resource is not monopolized by one person, but divided into the entire cloud system. Right. We have to use it together. Right. So, these things are connected with Rapid, and then Elasticity, Elasticity, and Demand, so it would be good to understand them. Right. Why is cloud computing important? In the era of big data and the 4th industrial revolution we see, this cloud system is distributing it from the most central core. The concept of IoT is, as I explained, the Internet of Things. So, the Internet of Things connects things and things. IoT exists, and then, as you can see here, big data is a concept between data and data, social is a concept between people and people, and mobile is a concept of terminal to terminal, but we don't move it ourselves, we do this. Big data and social network services are connected. Then, it connects people and data, and this connection is connected to data and things. Right. They are connected. So, each can be connected and used, but in the end, the cloud system plays a comprehensive role, a hub role, in the 4th and 3rd flat, so that various technologies needed can be combined. You can think of it as occupying an important portion in hardware, hardware. It would be good to read each one. There are important companies. These companies provide these things. They call it cloud architecture, but I guess many of you are seeing this for the first time, and many of you don't know. So it's a difficult concept, but to explain it simply, a computer has various functions inside, even though you only see one body. High-level architecture. For example, networking is the last thing that connects to an external computer or an external person, and there is storage space on top of it, and this is the spec, and Windows must be in the middle. There must be a Windows operating system, and if you go up to the top, you have installed various software on top of Windows. Right. You installed and used the Internet, and then Hangul, and then Excel, and installed and used games. We call these things specs, and among these things, SaaS needs to use all of these. If you want to use the application at the top, you have to use all the things below it, so you use this whole thing. We call this SaaS. PaaS only uses this middle module. Then EAS only uses OS. What does it mean? In the case of EAS, I rent a computer hardware. Then, I decide whether to install Windows or some OS on top of it, and then install some programs. Do you understand? So basically, we have EAS. Then, I rent the hardware and install the software on top of it and use it. We call this EAS. So, it rents infrastructure. The words are a bit difficult, but just think of it as renting a computer body like a hardware body and using whatever you want to install on it. You buy laptops or computers. It's the same. You can think of it as a concept of installing and using the computer software you need on top of it. SAS is this concept. Then, PASS is a bit difficult for you. This is a platform concept, and you can think of it as a middle concept between SAS and EAS. So, it provides a basic platform, and you use what kind of service to develop on that platform. So, it's similar to EAS, but it's one step above EAS, and we provide basic platforms. You may not know much about computers, so what is a platform? These things can be a bit difficult concepts. Right? Anyway, EAS and SAS and the concept of providing a platform in the middle and opening it so that services can be developed and used on top of it. I think it would be good to understand it as. We explained a lot about cloud computing. What is the concept of cloud computing? So, it's not a system where I buy and manage hardware like in the old days, but I can rent and use the hardware that others have made, and then I can rent and use the software that others develop. Most of it is the concept of SAS. Most of us use most of the companies and institutions by renting them. Most companies use SAS a lot rather than developing it themselves. I think it would be good to understand the concept that they use a lot. Today, we learned a lot about the 4th industrial revolution and cloud computing, and there were a lot of difficult contents. I hope you review it well. You worked hard today."""
